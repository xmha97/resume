**Freelancer**  (Aug/2012 to Aug/2015)\
**Role**: Web Developer
It was my first contact with programming. I started to learn how to code, and I developed some websites for small companies. I didn't know about any framework, so I developed most of my application using pure Java servlet application and no framework to deal with frontend (pure JS, CSS and HTML). It was really good to start that way to improve my understanding about how things work. As my last task there, I helped a friend develop an e-commerce and then I could improve my skills even more, and after that, when I was confident enough, I started looking for a job in a big company.

## Some phrases that I learned and I'm used to say

* Code so that everyone understands, review your code 1 week after writing it.
* Clean and explicit code, so that you can understand without comments, only following the script.
* Encapsulate really well working with domain and APIs defined.
* Code driven by domain, and not by technology. Everything could be plugged on your main code.
* Balance between simple and over engineer. Don't bring unnecessary complexity to your code.
* The decision of using a technology is: maturity, learning curve and community support.
